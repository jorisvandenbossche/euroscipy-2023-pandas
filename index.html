## Pandas Enhancement Proposals (PDEPs)

A PDEP is a proposal for a major change in pandas, similar to a Python PEP or a NumPy NEP.
See PDEPs on the pandas roadmap: https://pandas.pydata.org/about/roadmap.html

* PDEP-4 [*Implemented in 2.0* ]: Consistent datetime parsing
* PDEP-6 [*Accepted for 3.0* ]: Ban upcasting in setitem-like operations
* PDEP-7 [*Open, planned for 3.0* ]: Consistent copy/view semantics with Copy-on-Write
* PDEP-8 [*Open, planned for 3.0?* ]: Inplace methods in pandas
* PDEP-10 [*Accepted for 3.0* ]: PyArrow as a required dependency for default string inference implementation
* PDEP-11 [*Open* ]: Change the default of dropna to False

Other new pandas 2.0 features:

- Non-nanosecond datetime resolutions

---

# Non-nanosecond resolution in Timestamps

pandas only supported Timestamps in nanosecond resolution up until 2.0

--
count: false

.larger[&rarr;] Only dates between 1677 and 2262 can be represented

```python
>>> pd.Timestamp("1000-01-01")
OutOfBoundsDatetime: Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp: 1000-01-01 00:00:00

```

--
count: false

pandas 2.0 lifts this restriction!

Timestamps can be created in the following units:

- `seconds`
- `milliseconds`
- `microseconds`
- `nanoseconds`
---

## How to enable the new resolutions

`date_range` doesn't yet support non-nano resolutions. But `as_unit` or `astype` can be used to convert between units:

```python
>>> dr = pd.date_range("2020-01-01", periods=3, freq="D")
>>> dr
DatetimeIndex(['2020-01-01', '2020-01-02'], dtype=`'datetime64[ns]'`, freq='D')
```

--
count: false

```python
>>> dr.`astype("datetime64[s]")`
DatetimeIndex(['2020-01-01', '2020-01-02'], dtype=`'datetime64[s]'`, freq='D')
```

---
count: false

## How to enable the new resolutions

`date_range` doesn't yet support non-nano resolutions. But `as_unit` or `astype` can be used to convert between units:

The resolution of NumPy arrays is preserved:

```python
>>> arr = np.array(['2007-07-13', '2006-01-13'], dtype='datetime64[ms]')
>>> arr
array(['2007-07-13T00:00:00.000', '2006-01-13T00:00:00.000'], dtype=`'datetime64[ms]'`)

>>> pd.Series(arr)
0   2007-07-13
1   2006-01-13
dtype: `datetime64[ms]`
```

---

# PDEP-4: Consistent datetime parsing

Old behaviour: when not specifying a specific format, each value was being
parsed independently:

```python
>>> pd.to_datetime(['12-01-2000 00:00:00', '13-01-2000 00:00:00'])
DatetimeIndex([`'2000-12-01', '2000-01-13'`], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq=None)
```

--
count: false

New behaviour in pandas 2.0: if no `format` is specified, the format will be guessed from the first string and applied to all values

```python
>>> pd.to_datetime(['12-01-2000 00:00:00', '13-01-2000 00:00:00'])
...
# ValueError: time data "13-01-2000 00:00:00" doesn't match format "%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S".
# You might want to try:
#    - passing \`format` if your strings have a consistent format;
#    - passing \`format='ISO8601'` if your strings are all ISO8601 but not necessarily in exactly the same format;
#    - passing \`format='mixed'`, and the format will be inferred for each element individually. You might want to use `dayfirst` alongside this.
```

# PDEP-7: Consistent copy/view semantics in pandas with Copy-on-Write

### a.k.a. Getting rid of the SettingWithCopyWarning

# Current situation: SettingWithCopyWarning

```python
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [3, 4], "C": [5, 6]})
>>> subset = df[df["A"] > 1]
>>> subset.loc[1, "C"] = 10

*# SettingWithCopyWarning:

Copies and views in NumPy

explain a view in numpy

slicing gives view, mask gives copy

---

# The SettingWithCopyWarning

How to "solve" the warning?

--
count: false

I want do update `df` -> setitem in one go

```python
>>> df[df["A"] > 1]["C"] = 10      # this doesn't work
>>> df["C"][df["A"] > 1] = 10      # this works
>>> df.loc[df["A"] > 1, "C"] = 10  # this works
```

--
count: false

I don't want to update `df` -> explicit (unnecessary) `copy()`

```python
>>> subset = df[df["A"] > 1]`.copy()`
>>> subset["C"] = 10
```

---

# Current situation

Problems with the current copy / view semantics of pandas:

- This is confusing for many users
- You need to be aware of copy/view details of NumPy
- You need defensive (and unnecessary) copying to avoid the warning

---

# Can we do better?

A proposal for simplified behaviour using a single rule:

> *Any DataFrame or Series derived from another in any way (e.g. with an indexing operation) always *behaves as* a copy.*

--
count: false

Or put differently, the implication is:

> *Mutating a DataFrame or Series only changes the object itself, and not any other.*

> *If you want to change values in a DataFrame or Series, you can only do that by directly mutating the DataFrame/Series at hand*.


---

# Can we do better?

A proposal for simplified behaviour using a single rule:

> *Any DataFrame or Series derived from another in any way (e.g. with an indexing operation) always *behaves as* a copy.*

Advantages:

- .section-highlight[A simpler, more consistent user experience]
- We can get rid of the SettingWithCopyWarning (since there is no confusion about whether we are mutating a view or a copy)
- We would no longer need defensive copying in many places in pandas, improving memory usage and performance

---

## Previous example modifying a subset

```python
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [3, 4], "C": [5, 6]})
*>>> subset = df[df["A"] > 1]
>>> subset.loc[1, "C"] = 10
```

Did `df` change as well?

--
count: false

No, `subset` is a different object, so mutating `subset` does not change `df`.

And the answer is the same regardless how `subset` was created (selecting rows or columns, with a slice, mask, or list indexer, ..)

---

- We would no longer need defensive copying in many places in pandas, improving memory usage and performance

---

# The SettingWithCopyWarning

With current pandas (trying to update `df`):

```python
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [3, 4], "C": [5, 6]})
# two examples of chained assignment
>>> df["C"][df["A"] > 1] = 10  # this works
>>> df[df["A"] > 1]["C"] = 10  # this doesn't work
```

--
count: false

With new behaviour: both examples don't work

```python
>>> df["C"][df["A"] > 1] = 10  # this doesn't work
>>> df[df["A"] > 1]["C"] = 10  # this doesn't work
```

---

# The SettingWithCopyWarning

With current pandas (trying to update `df`):

```python
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [3, 4], "C": [5, 6]})
# two examples of chained assignment
>>> df["C"][df["A"] > 1] = 10  # this works
>>> df[df["A"] > 1]["C"] = 10  # this doesn't work
```

With new behaviour: chained assignment will never work -> we don't need the general warning.

But to help the transition, we can specifically warn about chained assignment not working:

.highlight-red[
```python
>>> df["C"][df["A"] > 1] = 10

*# ChainedAssignmentError: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame
*# or Series through chained assignment.
*# When using the Copy-on-Write mode, such chained assignment never works ...
```
]

---

> *Any DataFrame or Series derived from another in any way (e.g. with an indexing operation) always behaves as a copy.*

...
>>> subset["C"] = 10
```

With new behaviour: additional `copy()` is no longer needed to avoid the warning.

---

## Avoiding copies with Copy-on-Write

The usage of view vs copy can become an internal implementation detail

➔ We can avoid copies by default using Copy-on-Write!

--

**Small benchmark**: create DataFrame of 2 million rows by 30 columns (mix of float, integer and string columns)

```python
%%timeit
(df.rename(columns={"col_1": "new_index"})
   .assign(sum_val=df["col_1"] + df["col_2"])
   .drop(columns=["col_10", "col_20"])
   .astype({"col_5": "int32"})
   .reset_index()
   .set_index("new_index")
)
```

```
2.45 s ± 293 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
--
count: false

```
# with Copy-on-Write enabled
*13.7 ms ± 286 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

---

## How do I try this?

Enable it in pandas 2.0:

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True
```

* We encourage you to try it out!
* We expect it to become the default behaviour in pandas 3.0
* Blogposts:

# PDEP-10: PyArrow as a required dependency for default string inference implementation

---

## Avoid object dtype for strings by default

Currently:

```python
>>> pd.Series(["a", "b", "c"])
0    a
1    b
2    c
dtype: `object`
```

--
count: false

Future behaviour:

```python
>>> pd.options.future.infer_string = True
>>> pd.Series(["a", "b", "c"])
0    a
1    b
2    c
dtype: `string[pyarrow]`
```

Planned for 3.0 by default, but you can already opt-in starting with pandas 2.1

---

## PyArrow-backed string dtype

PyArrow offers fast and efficient in-memory string operations.

This provides:

- significantly improved performance compared to NumPy's object dtype with Python `str` operations
- smaller memory footprint

--
count: false

- compatible with existing object-dtype-based string methods (all `.str.` string accessor methods keep working)

---

## Let's look at some performance/memory comparisons

```python
import string
import random

import pandas as pd


def random_string() -> str:
    return "".join(random.choices(string.printable, k=random.randint(10, 100)))


ser_object = pd.Series([random_string() for _ in range(1_000_000)])
ser_string = ser_object.astype("string[pyarrow]")
```

---

## Let's look at some performance/memory comparisons

### str.length

```python
In[1]: %timeit ser_object.str.len()
118 ms ± 260 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

In[2]: %timeit ser_string.str.len()
*24.2 ms ± 187 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

--
count: false

### str.startswith

```python
In[3]: %timeit ser_object.str.startswith("a")
136 ms ± 300 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

In[4]: %timeit ser_string.str.startswith("a")
*11 ms ± 19.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)

```

---

## Let's look at some performance/memory comparisons

### memory footprint

```python
In [5]: "{:.2f} MiB".format(ser_object.memory_usage(deep=True) / 1024**2)
Out[5]: '106.82 MiB'

In [6]: "{:.2f} MiB".format(ser_string.memory_usage(deep=True) / 1024**2)
*Out[6]: '56.28 MiB'
```

---

## PyArrow-backed string dtype by default in 3.0

* PyArrow will become a **required** dependency of pandas starting with pandas 3.0
* The PyArrow-backed string dtype will be used by default for string columns (no more object dtype for strings!)


### How do I try this now?

Enable it in pandas 2.1:

```python
pd.options.future.infer_string = True
```

## Speeding up I/O operations with PyArrow engine

Some I/O functions gained an `engine` keyword to parse the input with PyArrow.

- `read_csv` and `read_json` can dispatch to PyArrow readers.
- `read_parquet` and `read_orc` use PyArrow natively to read the input.

???

Mention that engine works without the pandas backend as well

--
count: false

.larger[Benefits]

- Huge [performance improvements](https://datapythonista.me/blog/pandas-with-hundreds-of-millions-of-rows)
- Multithreading
- Zero-copy when using Arrow-backed DataFrames

---

## Arrow-backed data types

Using PyArrow arrays to store the data of a DataFrame.
.center[
![:scale 100%](img/pandas_arrow.svg)
]

 _ __Apache Arrow__ defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized_
_for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs._

---

## Arrow-backed data types

PyArrow offers support for a wide variety of dtypes (not well supported by pandas right now): 

* string, bytes, decimal, date, explicit null-datatype, nested data and [many more](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/datatypes.html#data-types-and-schemas).

--
count: false

.larger[Experimental `ArrowDtype` for using any Arrow type in a column]

```python
>>> import pyarrow as pa
>>> pd.Series([1, 2, 3], dtype=pd.ArrowDtype(pa.int64()))
0   1
1   2
2   3
dtype: `int64[pyarrow]`
```

These columns use the PyArrow memory layout and compute functionality.

--
count: false

➔ opt-in using new `dtype_backend="pyarrow"` keyword in IO methods, or `df.convert_dtypes(dtype_backend="pyarrow")` to convert afterwards

???

Warning: experimental!

---

## PDEP-6: Ban upcasting in setitem-like operations

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3]})
df.loc[1, "a"] = 3.5
df.loc[1, "a"] = "3"
```

--
count: false

When assigning a value into a Series that would cause the dtype to change, it is not clear
what the user wants to happen. Different users may want different things.

-> pandas shoudn't guess!

Summary: Assignments into an existing Series that would change the dtype will now raise.

Full proposal: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/50402

---

## PDEP-8: In-place methods in pandas

Proposal (still being discussed!):

- The `inplace` parameter will be deprecated and removed from any method that can never be done inplace
- The `inplace` parameter is kept only in a few methods such as `fillna()`

For example, replace

```python
df.reset_index(inplace=True)
```

with

```python
df = df.reset_index()
```

Full proposal: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/51466

---

## PDEP-11: Change the default of dropna to False

Motivating Example: Compute the average time for groups of 3 runners.

```python
df = pd.read_excel("runner_times.xlsx")
df.value_counts("group")
result = df.groupby("group")[["seconds"]].mean()
result.to_excel("group_means.xlsx")
```

- Some methods (`stack`, `pivot_table`) do not behave well with `dropna=False`
  - You can try the new implementation of `stack` in version 2.1!
- What should we do with `mode`?
  - If `mode` is counting values, then it should have `dropna=False`.
  - If `mode` is a stats method like `mean` and `median`, then it should have `skipna=True`

Full proposal: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/53094

---

## Pandas 2.1.0rc0

During our core sprint here in Basel, the pandas team released 2.1.0rc0!

```bash
pip install --pre pandas==2.1.0rc0
```

Highlights not already mentioned:

- DataFrame reductions preserve extension dtypes (e.g. PyArrow dtypes and nullable-dtypes)
- Performance improvement in groupby with PyArrow dtypes
- Many Copy-on-Write improvements
- Added `DataFrame.map`; deprecated `DataFrame.applymap`. The `na_action` argument works with extension dtypes.
- Better numba support in groupby
