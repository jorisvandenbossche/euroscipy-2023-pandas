## Examples: filtering rows with a boolean mask

```python

*>>> subset = df[df["A"] > 1]
>>> subset.loc[1, "A"] = 10
# SettingWithCopyWarning:
# A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
# Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead
#
# See the caveats in the documentation: ...

# Current situation

Problems with the current copy / view semantics of pandas:

- This is confusing for many users
- You need to be aware of copy/view details of numpy
- You need defensive (and unncecessary) copying to avoid the warning


???

Copies and views in NumPy

explain a view in numpy

slicing gives view, mask gives copy


---

# The SettingWithCopyWarning

To avoid "chained assignment (setitem)" pitfalls:

```python
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [3, 4], "C": [5, 6]})
>>> df["C"][df["A"] > 1] = 10  # this works
>>> df[df["A"] > 1]["C"] = 10  # this doesn't work
```

--
count: false

Rewriting the second case:

```python
>>> temp = df[df["A"] > 1]
>>> temp["C"] = 10
```

--
count: false

Our previous example:

```python
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [3, 4], "C": [5, 6]})
>>> subset = df[df["A"] > 1]
...
>>> subset["C"] = 10
```

---

# The SettingWithCopyWarning

How to "solve" the warning?

--
count: false

I want do update `df` -> setitem in one go

```python
>>> df[df["A"] > 1]["C"] = 10      # this doesn't work
>>> df`.loc[df["A"] > 1, "C"]` = 10  # this works
```

Or use `.assign(A=...)` method instead.

--
count: false

I don't want to update `df` -> explicit (unnecessary) `copy()`

```python
>>> subset = df[df["A"] > 1]`.copy()`
...
>>> subset["C"] = 10
```

## Intermezzo: copies and method chaining

Which steps of this workflow copy the DataFrame?

```python
(df
  .rename(columns=lambda col: col.replace(".", "_"))
  .assign(team_size=lambda df_: df_.team_size.replace(...))
  .astype({'employment_status': "category", ...})
  .drop(columns=[...])
  .dropna(subset="year")
  .reset_index()
)
```

The `inplace` keyword *sometimes* avoids the copy, but is not recommended.

# Can we do better?

A proposal for simplified behaviour using a single rule:

> *Any DataFrame or Series derived from another in any way (e.g. with an indexing operation) always *behaves as* a copy.*

--
count: false

Or put differently, the implication is:

> *Mutating a DataFrame only changes the object itself, and not any other.*

> *If you want to change values in a DataFrame or Series, you can only do that by directly mutating the DataFrame/Series at hand*.

# Can we do better?

A proposal for simplified behaviour using a single rule:

> *Any DataFrame or Series derived from another in any way (e.g. with an indexing operation) always *behaves as* a copy.*

Advantages:

- A simpler, more consistent user experience
- We can get rid of the SettingWithCopyWarning (since there is no confusion about whether we are mutating a view or a copy)
- We would no longer need defensive copying in many places in pandas, improving memory usage

No, `subset` is a different object, so mutating `subset` does not change `df`.

# The SettingWithCopyWarning

With current pandas:

```python
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [3, 4], "C": [5, 6]})
# two examples of chained assignment
>>> df["C"][df["A"] > 1] = 10  # this works
>>> df[df["A"] > 1]["C"] = 10  # this doesn't work
```

--
count: false

With proposal: both examples don't work

--
count: false

```python
>>> temp = df["C"]
>>> temp[temp["A"] > 1] = 10
```

Chained assignment will never work -> we don't need a warning.

# The SettingWithCopyWarning

With current pandas:

```python

>>> subset = df[df["A"] > 1]`.copy()`
...
>>> subset["C"] = 10
```

With proposal: additional `copy()` is no longer needed to avoid the warning.
